# CS210 Titanic Data Analysis

Python project analyzing the Titanic dataset to explore survival patterns and visualize relationships between passenger features. This project demonstrates data analysis, statistical computation, and visualization skills.

---

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify trends in survival and visualize relationships between variables.
- **Dataset:** Cleaned Titanic dataset (`titanic_clean.csv`) containing passenger information, including age, class, fare, family size, and survival status.
- **Key Features:**
  - Load CSV data into a structured dictionary.
  - Summarize numerical and categorical data (min, max, mean, stdev, mode, unique values).
  - Compute Pearson correlation coefficients between variables.
  - Visualize survival patterns using scatterplots.
  - Extra credit: Bar charts showing survival counts and percentages by category (e.g., gender).
